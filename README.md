Harveer's Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website showcasing a collection of my projects, professional skills, and experience. Built as a fast, responsive Single Page Application using Blazor WebAssembly, .NET 9, and styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern look and feel.

The site features smooth client-side routing and a clean UI, with an automated CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions that builds, tests, and deploys the app seamlessly to GitHub Pages.

Feel free to explore the projects and learn more about my work!
